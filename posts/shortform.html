            I like thinking about transparent, steerable systems of data and governance. These days, Iâ€™m involved in <a href="https://baulab.info/">AI safety efforts</a> between Boston and Cambridge.

            Outside of work, I care deeply about teaching. In my spare time I enjoy lifting weights, playing guitar, and reading.
